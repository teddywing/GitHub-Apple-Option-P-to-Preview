GitHub Apple-Option-P to Preview
================================

A [Greasemonkey][1] user script that allows GitHub’s comment Preview pane to be
toggled with the keyboard shortcut `Apple-Option-P`.

By default, GitHub uses `Apple-Shift-P` for this function. In Firefox,
`Apple-Shift-P` opens a new private browsing window, shadowing GitHub’s
shortcut.

This script provides a mechanism to easily toggle the Preview pane in Firefox
without having to modify internal application shortcuts.


## Install
Ensure Greasemonkey is installed and activated. Open the [raw script][2] and
click “Install” in the resulting dialog. A [more detailed explanation][3] is
available on the Greasemonkey wiki.
